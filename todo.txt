Bug in DFA and NFA

    If a state with an ANY edge and any other edge (q), we need to go through q and do stuff from there.
    It is two different ways of reaching the same destination

    If we can accept abe and .*

        a -a> b
        a -ANY> c
        b -b> e
        e -e> d
        c ->ANY>c

    We need to add edges to b, e and d with an ANY-edge to c. Like this
    
        a -a>       b
        a -ANY>     c
        b -b>       e
        b -ANY>     c
        e -e>       d
        e -ANY>     c
        c ->ANY>    c
        d ->ANY>    c

    We also need to add the precedence when consuming chars in the states.
        1) Normals
        2) DIGIT & ALPH
        3) ANY

Add unit tests. Things break all the  time...
