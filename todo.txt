The correct functions aren't passed correctly from NFA to their DFA counterpart.
    I will be needing a fix for this.
        * Maybe I could make the "walk" and choose that one.
            accept: "int" and ".*"

            If I start with i -> n -> t then it should choose this function.
                However, if I do anything other than this, the other function is chosen.

            Longest name match?
            Priority?
            
Add unit tests. Things break all the  time...
